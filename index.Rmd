## PFAS are structurally diverse

???

- 74 Compounds in USEPA's initial PFAS screening library 
- Mixture of Legacy and novel PFAS
- Varying chain length's
- varying head groups 
- **Enough of both to make comparisons...**
- How to do toxicogy testing given number of compounds?

???

- False-coloured SEM of a zebrafish embryo.
- tropical freshwater fish originating from eastern Asia and is a member of the minnow family. 
- embryo as a disease model, an assay system for drug screening and is used in cancer research. 
- Suitable for biomedical rersearch: embryos develop quickly 
  - single cell in a fertilized egg to tiny fish in 24 hours 
  - vertebrates

- **16**: N-Methylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **24**: N-Ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **34**: Perfluoro-3,6,9-trioxatridecanoic acid
- **36**: Methyl perfluorohexanoate
- **46**: Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
- **60**: Perfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **74**: Perfluorooctanoic acid
- Single point testing is slow, and like finding a needle in a hay stack 
- Need a deeper picture to understand what's going
- Since proteins are movers and shakers, why not look at them.

## Proteomics (conceptually)

- b/c of ctrls, deviations form normal at this point can be sig for development
- rough explanation of proteomics to situate folks


---
## Time vs. coverage 

- constraints on run times (scan #s)
- introduce dimethyl labelling & link to tox study (L, M, H)

---
## DIA-NN vs. MQ

## QA/QC from data 

- correlation of dimeth0 channels -> doesn't matter that the intensities don't matter, 

---
## Batch effect corrections (must be a way to use dimethyl labelling) 

---
## Compound 16 insights

- volcano plots of high and low exposure (linked proteins)

---
## Network pathway enrichment of compound 16

---
## Heat map of total protein up and down regulation 

```{r, out.width = "1000px", fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/mayHeatmap.png") 

```


- clustering 
- elaborate on expanding scope to 74 pfas

## PFAS class effects (try and link to Tox Data)
