## Much ado about PFAS

???

- 74 Compounds in USEPA's initial PFAS screening library 
- Mixture of Legacy and novel PFAS
- Varying chain length's
- varying head groups 
- **Enough of both to make comparisons...**
- How to do toxicogy testing given number of compounds?

- *Point out*: 
  - *EYES*
  - *Mouth* 
  - *Pericardial Edema*: fluid build-up around heart
  - *Spinal curvature*: tail supposed to detach from yoke-salk, and straighten out. 
  - *Tail Dysplasia*: malformations of tail fins.  
- *Embryo's are transparent*
- False-coloured SEM of a zebrafish embryo.
- tropical freshwater fish originating from eastern Asia and is a member of the minnow family. 
- embryo as a disease model, an assay system for drug screening and is used in cancer research. 
- Suitable for biomedical rersearch: embryos develop quickly 
  - single cell in a fertilized egg to tiny fish in 24 hours 
  - vertebrates

## OECD has adopted Fish Embryo Toxicity testing for acute fish toxicity measurements as it's logistically simpler and more reproducible

- Fish embryos until the onset of independent feeding are considered as nonprotected life stages
- Easy to maintain in lab
- beter interlab reproducibility

## Traditional fish embryo toxicity endpoints are poor predictors of </br>weak acute and sublethal toxicities


```{r, out.width = "1000px", fig.align = "center"}

- *20 embryos per exposure, 3 exposure replicates*
- **16**: N-Methylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **24**: N-Ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **34**: Perfluoro-3,6,9-trioxatridecanoic acid
- **36**: Methyl perfluorohexanoate
- **46**: Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
- **60**: Perfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **74**: Perfluorooctanoic acid
- Single point testing is slow, and like finding a needle in a hay stack 
- Need a deeper picture to understand what's going
- Since proteins are movers and shakers, why not look at them.

## Low- and high-conc PFAS exposures were performed in triplicate; labelling accounts for batch and matrix effects

## Data Independent Acquisition(DIA) captures much more sample information compared to traditional Data-Dependant Acquisition (DDA)
