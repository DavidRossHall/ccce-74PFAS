- 74 Compounds in USEPA's initial PFAS screening library 
- Mixture of Legacy and novel PFAS
- Varying chain length's
- varying head groups 
- **Enough of both to make comparisons...**

## OECD has adopted Fish Embryo Toxicity testing for acute fish toxicity measurements as it's logistically simpler and more reproducible

- Fish embryos until the onset of independent feeding are considered as nonprotected life stages
- Easy to maintain in lab
- beter interlab reproducibility

## Traditional fish embryo toxicity endpoints are poor predictors of </br>weak acute and sublethal toxicities

- *20 embryos per exposure, 3 exposure replicates*
- **16**: N-Methylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **24**: N-Ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **34**: Perfluoro-3,6,9-trioxatridecanoic acid
- **36**: Methyl perfluorohexanoate
- **46**: Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
- **60**: Perfluorooctanesulfonamide
- **74**: Perfluorooctanoic acid
- Single point testing is slow, and like finding a needle in a hay stack 
- Need a deeper picture to understand what's going
- Since proteins are movers and shakers, why not look at them.
